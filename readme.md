# CardoBlast

I am creating a game for the Playdate console called CardoBlast. It is a top-down RPG game with a pixel art style where a magician fights against monsters in different areas.
I haven't decided yet if I will add a story or not, but I am thinking about it. I initially created this project to practice C++ and create something that I can share with the others.
Why? Usually, Everything I worked on is private, and I wanted to change that.

## Documentation
